Now you know the tank was cut in half and turned on its side so that the side  of the old image becomes the real roof. 

At night in your proper bedroom with the slated roof and the insulated walls, the clothes on the back of your chair become a Strega with a hooked nose. She doesnâ€™t scare you. But her morning acts of disappearance do. 

As a child in the bedroom, you could imagine many places better to live than a water tank. The bedroom that could fit the water tank inside of it maybe, if you could visualise and then measure the parameters.  

You walk the parameters of the story , graze your hand on the corrugated iron edges.
